# What is this?
This is the same poimandres, but when I installed it, i did noticed that in Golang, the name of the functions were blue, while in the picture of the theme, they were green, so I just changed that color.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

_**IMPORTANT!** The `setup` function has to be invoked before the colorscheme is set!_

Install with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
-- Lua

{ 
  'sponkurtus2/poimandres.nvim',
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  config = function()
    require('poimandres').setup {
      -- leave this setup function empty for default config
      -- or refer to the configuration section
      -- for configuration options
    }
  end,

  -- optionally set the colorscheme within lazy config
  init = function()
    vim.cmd("colorscheme poimandres")
  end
}
```
